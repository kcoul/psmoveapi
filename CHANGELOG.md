## [Unreleased]

### Added

- macOS: Add build support for M1/Apple Silicon (Fixes #440)
- Linux/Debian: Force building tracker and test programs (Fixes #437)
- Added `psmove_tracker_opencv.h` for OpenCV-specific functions
- `psmove_fusion_glm.h`: Convenience wrapper functions returning `glm` types
- `psmove_tracker_glm.h`: Convenience wrapper functions returning `glm` types
- `psmove_tracker_count_connected()` now returns the number of connected V4L2 video devices on Linux
- `psmove_tracker_get_next_unused_color()` for previewing the next tracked color
- Added (Linux) support for PS4 Camera (tested with CUH-ZEY2) and PS5 Camera (tested with CFI-ZEY1)
- `psmove_tracker_get_camera_info()` to get some metadata about the current camera
- new sub-command `test-undistortion` for `psmove` to test a calibration XML file
- New hue-based fast color calibration: `psmove_tracker_hue_calibration()`
- Runtime color calibration reset using `psmove_tracker_reset_color_calibration()`

### Changed

- CI: Migrate from Travis CI (macOS, Linux), and AppVeyor (Windows) to Github Actions
- Linux: Build OpenCV from source
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Add check for 'git submodule init' (Fixes #352)
- New binary magnetometer calibration format (Fixes #452); this changes the
  file format and controllers might need to be re-calibrated after the update;
  the filename also changed from "BTADDR.magnetometer.csv" to "BTADDR.magnetometer.dat"
- Update build instructions for newer versions
- Updated OpenCV to Version 4
- `external/libusb-1.0`: Updated to revision f3619c40 for VS2022 support
- `external/PS3EYEDriver`: Update to latest revision
- `psmove firmware-info`: List firmware info for all connected controllers (not just the first one),
  print device model number
- `psmove_fusion_get_position()` now determines the Z coordinate of the controller
  analytically based on the current projection and projected size on the X axis
- `external/glm`: Update to version 0.9.9.8
- New logging system and macros, includes source file names and line numbers
- CMake minimum requirement version bumped to version 3.16 (the version in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- Require C++14 support (previously was C++11)
- Slightly improved annotation overlay for `psmove_tracker_annotate()`
- Camera tracking-related tools are now merged into the `psmove` CLI utility
- `psmove_tracker_annotate()` got additional parameters for showing/hiding the status bar and ROIs
- Tracker dimming factor is now limited to between 0.01 (1% intensity) and 1.0 (100% intensity)
- Camera devices on Linux - when using OpenCV - are now properly detected and enumerated even if
  there are "holes" in the numbering (e.g. /dev/video1 exists, but /dev/video0 does not)
- Renamed `calibration_blink_delay` in tracker settings to `calibration_blink_delay_ms`
- `psmove_tracker.h`: Default value for width/height/framerate is now -1 (to auto-pick a good value)
- `psmove_tracker.h`: Camera exposure is now a float between 0.0 and 1.0, independent of camera API
- Replaced `enum PSMove_Bool`, `PSMove_True` and `PSMove_False` with C99 (`stdbool.h`) / C++ `bool`, `true`, `false`
- Increased maximum number of tracked controllers from 5 to 7
- Blinking calibration now takes the new hue-based quality criteria into account, does per-controller dimming

### Fixed

- Fixed linking on macOS (`libSecurity`)
- Fix macOS version detection for macOS 11 and newer (fixes #456)
- `examples/labs/`: Fix building of Qt examples by migrating to Qt 5
- Fixed the kernel center of CV-related image filters (was off-center before)

- Removed `psmove_tracker_set_dimming()` and `psmove_tracker_get_dimming()`, removed global `dimming_factor` from tracker settings
  (replaced with automatic per-controller dimming during color calibration)
- Removed `psmove_tracker_set_camera_color()` without replacement
- Removed `PSMOVE_TRACKER_ROI_SIZE` environment variable

## [4.0.4] - 2017-09-14

This release adds support for easily pairing with multiple controllers on
Linux, removes support for the old BlueZ 4 version (BlueZ 5 is the only
Bluetooth stack supported on Linux now) and improves runtime detection support
for the Pocket C.H.I.P ARM-based Linux computer.

On the macOS front, we now require the pairing tool to be ran as root user or
with sudo, this avoids having to query the password when the Bluetooth
configuration needs to be updated. For macOS 10.12.6, using more than two
controllers is supported by using an external Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongle.

For Windows, this release adds support for building both 64- and 32-bit
variants of the library and uses a custom version of hidapi that allows for
proper pairing of Bluetooth controllers. Visual Studio 2017 is now also
supported as compiler in addition to VS2013, VS2015 and MinGW (both 32- and
64-bit).

The static libraries are not built anymore, users are recommended to use the
shared library.


## [4.0.1] - 2016-12-27

This release fixes various Bluetooth pairing / configuration issues on Linux
and adds support for the Pocket C.H.I.P portable Linux computer.


## [4.0.0] - 2016-12-26

This release adds the `psmoveapi.h` header for a new high-level, event-based
API to access controllers without having to interface with the low-level
details.  There's also new ctypes-based Python 3 bindings for PS Move API, and
we've cleaned up the build process to easily build and deploy releases in
Travis CI and AppVeyor.
